#summary Release Notes

= Release Notes =

== Version 1.2 (SVN Revision 12) ==

  * Errors that occur on server side are not relayed back to client. Client has new error reasons for them in the controller.
  * Client callback behavior is faithful replication of server callback scenarios:
    * Callback is called with good response.
    * Callback is not called.
    * Callback is called with null.
    * Callback is called with empty protocol buffer.
  * Added comprehensive unit tests for client and server.

== Version 1.1 (SVN Revision 9) ==

  * Added error handling. When errors occur, the client can find out what error occurred from the controller.
  * Started adding unit tests.
